# Count down timer

Timer is found here: https://dan503.github.io/countdown-timer/

Use space bar to start.

The tool works best in Chrome.

The tool does not work in IE.

The tool kind of works in Firefox but it's buggy.
I would love to make it work in Firefox properly but `e.preventDefault()` doesn't seem to work on key strokes in Firefox.
Considering that all the functionality is keyboard driven it makes getting the timer to work properly in firefox practically impossible.

Firefox also doesn't seem to support the method that is being used to prevent your computer from going to sleep while the timer is active.
