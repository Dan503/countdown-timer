# Atomic Categorizer

One of the hardest things for new developers to pick up on when it comes to [Atomic Design](http://bradfrost.com/blog/post/atomic-web-design/) is deciding on what category a particular component should be categorized under.

To help with this problem, I've put together an Atomic Design categorization tool.

This tool is basically a simple quiz that scores each category based on your answers. It then recommends the highest scoring category to you.

You can try it out here: https://dan503.github.io/Atomic-Categorizer/

The tool does not work in IE.
